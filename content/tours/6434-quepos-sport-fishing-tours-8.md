Quepos is one of the World’s finest and most famous sport fishing locations, named by Marlin Magazine as one of the best spots for action all year-round.

In-shore angling requires only a short run to the fishing grounds, it’s relatively inexpensive and offers great views of the coast of Manuel Antonio.

Expect lots of Rooster fish, Dorado (Mahi-Mahi), Jack Crevalle, Snapper, and Mackerel to complete your catch.

The offshore reefs will provide good numbers of Amberjack, Red Snapper, Tuna, Black Marlin, and all the Sailfish you can imagine when in season.
