Team Building Adventure while Rafting

There is no better way to get a team to work together, build trust and improve communication than having them experience the thrill of paddling down an exciting tropical river deep in the jungles of Costa Rica!

Our experienced, certified rafting guides will help your team learn new skills in cooperation, encourage mutual respect and have a lot of fun along the way!

How you’ll improve communication:

Rafting requires giving and following instructions, so this unique whitewater experience will allow each team mate to rotate and spend time as the “guide” and give paddling instructions to his or her blindfolded boat crew.

The designated “guide(s)” will have to get everyone to work together to navigate downriver to earn points by retrieving special markers along the way.

Learn to build trust:

Each 5-member raft team will rotate guides until each person has had a chance to guide the raft to retrieve their markers.

Employees will build trust in each other as their “guide” gives instructions and communicates to the team on how to reach each marker.

Once all members have rotated as the “guide” and retrieved as many markers as possible, we return to our private Operations Center located on the Sarapiqui River for a symbolic awards ceremony, tree ðŸŒ³ planting and delicious customized lunch.

This is an activity your team will never forget!
