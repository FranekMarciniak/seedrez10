advice: "Families love this La Fortuna Safari Float. A perfect tour for all ages! One of the best Arenal tours for families visiting La Fortuna and those who want to take it easy on their vacation in Costa Rica. Have a look at our Adventure Waiver if you have questions about our Costa Rica adventure tour policies.

For events that could happen beyond our control (such as low water levels) we may change to a more-suitable tour with an equal or similar adventure-appeal or offer other tour options so you don't miss out on a fun day in Costa Rica. We reserve the right to cancel a trip due to unfavorable conditions & will only run a tour according to our policies. Full refund is given if (on rare occasion) no tour is run."

Jungle Safari Float on the Sarapiqui River

Come see the abundance of nature and wildlife that Costa Rica has to offer! This Costa Rica Safari Float is a smooth, two-hour paddle down the quiet, lower section of the Sarapiqui River and great for nature lovers of all ages —especially children and their parents! Your bilingual nature guide will paddle and steer your boat as you float down the river and point out all of the exotic wildlife such as birds, frogs, insects, and monkeys in the Costa Rica rainforest!

We will start down the river at our restaurant, the Red Eye Frog located in El Roble de Sarapiqui and finish up in Jacare.

Your eagle-eyed guide will show off Costa Rica's amazing wildlife as he points out a wide array of plant and animal species. You’ll float next to the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor (San Juan La Selva Biological Corridor) where there is a good possibility of seeing sloths, howler monkeys, lizards, and even black river otters.

Plus, this area is famous for its incredible amount of tropical birds such as ospreys, boat-billed herons, parrots, kingfishers and the great green macaw which is on the endangered species list.

For those who want to be even closer to nature, you will have the chance to get out of the raft and into the river and refresh yourself as we go down the river.

The Jungle Safari Float is great for nature lovers of all ages – children love this tour! It’s also perfect for couples or large groups who want to spend some quality time and relax together in the middle of a tropical paradise!

And to finish your day we will return to the Red Eye Frog Restaurant to have a delicious traditional Costa Rican lunch called a “Casado” along with some amazing Costa Rican gourmet coffee.
