advice: "We recommend the morning time slot for doing the Stand Up Paddle tour on Lake Arenal. Lake Arenal often has strong winds and rain storms in the afternoon while the morning tour offers great wildlife viewing and calmer waters. Have a look at our Adventure Waiver if you have questions about our adventure tour policies.

This adventure involves some inherent risk and physical exertion, so you must be in good physical condition without any recent surgery, heart condition, pregnancy, disability or injury. You should know how to swim and feel comfortable in water. We cannot guarantee you will not fall off of board while SUP. Desafio Adventure Company reserves the right to cancel any trip due to unsafe conditions and will only run a tour according to established company policies."

Stand Up Paddle SUP on Lake Arenal

Venture to Costa Rica's largest lake and hop on board our private boat as your guide and captain load up with stand up paddle gear and a cooler full of icy bottled water and fresh fruits. We will start at our Pedal & Paddle Operations Center in the small town of Foforos on Lake Arenal.

As we embark on our journey out to the middle of Lake Arenal, you’ll be blown away by all of the natural beauty of Volcano Arenal.

The mountains that surround the lake are different shades of green, as some are in the foreground while the others fade into the distance. At first, the Arenal Volcano seems like it is hidden behind mountains, but if you get to a certain part in the lake you’ve reached the sweet spot – a spot where you can see the detailed textures of its rock formation and where passing in front of it can make you feel tiny.

When you reach the middle of the lake, your guide will give you plenty of safety instructions and plunk your board into the water. Paddle out on your knees and when you are ready, stand up and find your balance! The calm waters in Arenal make this a perfect sport for people of all ages and all skill levels.

It’s a great activity for people who just want to be on a freshwater lake, soaking up the sun in gorgeous scenery with plenty of opportunity for conversation. About half way through the tour we’ll paddle to an island where you can relax, crack open the cooler, and fuel up with a refreshing and well-deserved snack. Qué Rico!
